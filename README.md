# home-page
## Replacement for the boring New Tab and Home pages.
> This application has been made for private use, but you are more than welcome to use it yourself if you'd like.

```
This application will upon your first inspection ask for your name.
It stores the data into local storage, from where it will fetch your inputs whenever you open the app.
You can change your name by clicking on the cogwheel to open the settings menu.
Also you can remove your todo by clicking on the UI buttons.
```

```
BE ADVISED:
This was not intended to be responsive... yet. It's been made solely to run fullscreen on your browser.
So if you encounter that some of the elements overlap, that is why.

EDIT 21/7/2018:
Added responsiveness for use with mobile devices.
